# Fungals
There is so much room to make friends. Go around and explore this tiny world with your Fungals and explore nature while finding balance within yourself and the world. This is a casual and cozy mobile game designed for portrait mode gameplay. The player is placed in an empty garden and must bond with the Fungals to forage mushrooms,  farm produce, and build structures.

A mobile game built using Unity.
